# Urban Fashion website layout challenge

## Task: Recreate the website shown in .pdf

The most difficult part was getting the social media icons into a fixed position.

However after leaving this project and coming back to it after a few weeks, I was able to resolve the issue with minimal fuss.

I was able to recognise what I was doing wrong or rather recognise that my previous attempts were on the right track but applied to the wrong elements.

Things like this make me realise how far I've come since I started building this layout challenge.

My heart initially sank when I looked at my code and saw that my past self had left no comments.
However, this wasn't anything like the past me, my css classes were chosen well and the code itself was so tidy, I found I didn't need any.

I was able to manipulate the elements as if I had written the code yesterday, making the necessary adjustments to the CSS rules I had written previously.

I didn't even need to write any new rules, just a few changes to what was already coded.

However a small step this may seem to anyone reading this, this was a huge revelation to me, that I have retained what I'm learning and can utilise what I have learned to find a solution to a problem I thought I had.
